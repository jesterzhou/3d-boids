boids by craig reynolds

"boid" or "bird-oid object" refers to a bird like object, the interactions / behavior of each boid in a cluster adhere to rules.

1. seperation: steer to avoid crowding. i.e. boids avoid collision. 
2. alignment: match the vector (velocity) of neighboring boids.
3. cohesion: steer towards the center of mass. 

in this implementation of boids, the library used will be three.js to render the scene and boids. instead of birds, we would be using fish ... "foids".
